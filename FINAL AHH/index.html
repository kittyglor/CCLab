                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>The Flickers are the only known sentient species of flame, closely related to campfires, flickering
                    flames, and all things fiery. Unlike your average fire, they have a personality all their own!

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Flickers are true adventurers! Unlike ordinary flames, they can thrive almost anywhere—even
                    underwater. These little explorers love to venture into new landscapes and gobble up everything in
                    their path. With their unique ability to generate air pockets, they can navigate underwater worlds
                    with ease, though they must be careful not to pop their bubbles! It's hard to pin down their
                    “natural” habitat, as they defy the usual rules of heat and fire and even gravity. Often elusive,
                    they can cleverly disguise themselves as regular candle flames if you’re not paying attention,
                    darting away on their tiny legs when unwatched.

            <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>This particular Flicker boasts a vibrant orange and yellow glow, but watch closely! When interacting
                    with others, it shifts to a stunning blue. Researchers are unsure if this is a sign of distress or
                    excitement, or perhaps some sort of biological defense mechanism.

                <ul>
                    <li>Flickers can transform into five playful sizes on command! (Press 1-5)</li>
                    <li>Some Flickers can regenerate upon flickering out… </li>
                    <li>Flickers can generate sparks when they look at the stars! (Click Space)</li>
                    <li>They can blend in as ordinary candle flames for stealthy exploration.</li>
                </ul>

                <span class="yellow">What do we know so far about these flame creatures?</span>

            <p>Folklore says that Flickers were born from the laughter of stars, which is why their fiery souls have a
                boundless sense of adventure, darting through dreamscapes and gliding across oceans. With short
                lifespans of just a year, these flame creatures make the most of their time seeing the world.
                Interestingly enough, they seem to steer clear of one another and prefer solo travels. It is said that
                when they flicker out of
                existence, they return as sparks to the stars they were originally borne from. Note that this specific
                flicker seems to be able to regenerate when it’s been snuffed out, usually being reborn in the closest
                candle. Many humans have sought to domesticate Flickers, but their swift and hot nature have made that
                an impossible task. However, for those fortunate enough to befriend or observe one of these fragile and
                spirited creatures, they might bring you along for a brief adventure! Some humans have even claimed to
                be able to converse with Flickers.</p>



            <br>
            <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span>
            <p>Humans can lead and
                direct the curious Flickers if they think you’re interesting enough to be listened to! Depending on the
                environment, the Flicker might move differently. Simply accompany the Flicker as it moves around and
                discover how it transforms as it travels between destinations.</p>
